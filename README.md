Flow_py_bargraphe is a Python program to control a Bronkhorst's instrument with a computer (or laptop) working under Windows 7,8,10.
 The overall structure of the program is the same in Flow_py_afficheur (https://github.com/EstelleDutheil/Bronkhorst_programme_afficheur) 
 The use of "module tkinter" allows to create a human machine interface.
 Others modules are here for :
  "recherche_creation_ports" creation of a bond between computer and instrument (via RS232)
  "trames_fonctions" translation of coded message from and for the instrument.
  "convertisseur_ ..." are modules to convert hexa decimal data in characters, string, floats ....
